# Demand-Forecasting-on-Time-Series-Data
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.Here, I used a simple air passengers datase to predict the number of passengers in upcoming time. I used the model SARIMAX (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors)- an advanced version of the ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model to generate the forecasting in python.
